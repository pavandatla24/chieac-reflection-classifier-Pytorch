"1015975-369796 - Cameron Fowlks - May 1, 2025 1148 AM - chieac reflection.docx",i did not experience any challenges or moments of growth i was an outside party who had a closet with too much clothing in it and was happy to give the clothing to someone who would appreciate it yes i also responded to some surveys but i never shared them with anyone because everyone i know is just like me and would most certainly have gone eheheh oookay and not filled out the survey also im sure my perspective was very unique but i know youre not plastering them anywhere because they arent supportive of any argument you want to make i refuse to fabricate a touchy feely reflection on something i simply did not do if you give me a 0 on this i will not complain i have no problem with you personally dr drury but the good things youre trying to do did not apply to me especially the idea that i was a social research assistant if an employer were to see that and go gee golly this guy has social work under his belt now ill hire him that is not somewhere i want to work again i appreciate the thought and the effort but its simply not for me thank you
"1061021-369795 - Lizzie Salmons - May 4, 2025 232 PM - ChiEAC Research Assistant Reflection.docx",chieac research assistant reflection lizzie salmons serving migrant and refugee families taught me that these families face barriers that not a lot of people think about in their day to day lives for example most people do not have to think about not being able to afford clothing providing clothing for migrant and refugee families made me realize that i should be grateful for the clothes that i have in my closet i am able to collect clothes for fun because i have a good amount of money but migrant and refugee families may not have enough money to afford nicelooking clothing my role in collecting and distributing clothing for migrant and refugee families did not honestly shift the way i view mutual aid that much i already knew what mutual aid was before i took on the role of collecting and distributing clothing therefore i was not surprised to see mutual aid in action im not really sure any strong emotions came up for me as i gave away clothing i have given away clothing plenty of times before na this experience confirmed for me that a community united for one cause is a powerful community the fact that we were able to raise 2000 for chieacs 2025 community impact fund is incredible as is the fact that we were able to donate 500 pounds of clothing it has become even clearer to me after this experience that the future must be a future that is communityoriented not profitoriented we must work to redistribute power so that it is in the hands of the many not the few this will require us to revolutionize the way we think about community my time with chieac as i briefly mentioned above made me realize that the future must be communityoriented as opposed to profitoriented if our society continues to remain a society built on the idea that we should always be chasing profit instead of caring for others humanity will only get greedier more selfish more competitive and more disconnected from what makes us human in addition searching endlessly for profit will damage the planet one cannot have infinite growth on a finite planet we must destroy any systems of oppression before they destroy us
"1065754-369797 - Syed Farid - May 5, 2025 658 PM - project reflection.docx",1 serving migrant and refugee families in chicago taught me that trust is built through consistency empathy and cultural respect many families are afraid to open up and seek help once they do get comfortable it means to listen and understand what they are going through and how you can help them 2 taking on the responsibility of collecting clothing raising funds and organizing community support helped me understand that aid is about solidarity not charity it showed me that power of people coming together to care for one another directly without waiting on a large institutions it really opened my eyes that if people come together as a community we can really make a difference 3 the research study that resonated most with me was advertising the survey on social media and trying to get my family and friends to donate some of my family and friends did donate and that showed me that by bringing it up once around family members or posting it on my social media and getting just a few people to donate can really help a lot of people in need 4 this experience really showed me that these big communities and organizations play a very big role in addressing complex issues like job research these organizations are powerful because they are rooted in relationships and lived in experience but they cant solve everything alone i now see their strength in building trust and adapting quickly but also understand the need for a solid system of support to make their efforts sustainable and far reaching 5 looking back at the chieac project i realize that in about six months the class really did a whole lot for the community in the future i definitely want to volunteer for my community and give back to them and go to my local mosque and help volunteer there as well i definitely will make it a goal to do what i can for my community

support efforts articulate your role in at least one of the chieac research studies and meaningfully connect this experience to your learning skill development and commitment to social impact please submit your completed responses as a single document to the d2l assignment folder titled chieac research assistant reflection by the posted deadline question 1 what did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reflect on specific moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity question 1 response serving migrant and refugee families in chicago taught me that trust and advocacy go together throughout the entire process and that building trust is more of a gradual process instead of something that can be rushed this is especially for families who have experienced trauma and displacement i learned that systematic barriers like language immigration status and not being familiar with the us educational system can create a lot of obstacles for these families trying to access basic resources families could be afraid or hesitant to engage with local schools due to fear and uncertainty on their legal status these experiences have taught me that being an advocate is not just about providing information but it is also about creating a safe and welcoming place for families in need to feel heard and supported i also learned that it is important to focus on educational equity as well it is not enough to only offer equal resources but you have to make sure that those resources are accessible for everyone no matter the circumstance or obstacles this work made me more committed to social justice and it made me realize how inclusive policies need to address the needs of communities in order to create real educational equity question 2 how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizing what emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time question 2 response my role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support gave me a deep and more personal understanding of mutual aid and grassroots organizing as acts of solidarity rather than charity being a part of collecting clothes that were given to clothing drives for families in crisis showed me how mutual air is about meeting peoples immediate needs although these people are in need they still require dignity and respect there have been many times in the past mostly in high school where in the wintery cold months we did a clothing drive in order to collect coats jackets hats gloves and other items many lack during the winter time many students who donated came back immediately ready to help out and donate older unused items for people in need sometimes you would even see wealthier families in the school purchase newer items just to donate to those in need the urgency and humanity participating in these clothing drives has stayed with me even when participating in this project in college it made me realize that when people care a community can be really powerful when they are grounded in relationships and shared responsibility this experience has reshaped my understanding of organizing a community helping me see it not only as a power tool for change but as a vital means of survival and empowerment for those who need it most question 3 of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy question 3 response study 1 which surveyed attitudes towards career readiness and barriers to job searching among low income students and caregivers was the most impactful for me because it reflected many of the economic and educational struggles that ive witnessed not only in my community but all around the world as i helped partake in this survey i learned that many people often face feelings of frustration uncertainty and being overlooked by institutions that are supposed to be there for them many people experience limited access to professional networks lack of affordable childcare or even unfamiliarity with online job platforms answering these questions made me think more deeply about those around me and what they may be experiencing participating in this study made me realize that the role of data isnt just about the numbers you collect rather how you can use that data to advocate for solutions whether it is school based or job readiness preparation this project inspired me to be more committed to using research as a form of advocacy we should all be working together to listen to peoples needs their experiences and how we can change or help their lives question 4 how did this experience challenge or confirm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work question 4 response this experience really strengthened my appreciation and belief on the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and navigating technology in daily life before becoming a part of the chicago education advocacy cooperative i knew community organizations played an important role in filling institutional gaps but i now realize that they often function as critical lifelines for migrant and refugee families facing systemic barriers it requires patience cultural sensitivity and practical resourcefulness to thrive when participating in chieac in these moments it is confirmed that these qualities are important to help those who are in need thrive well seeing more success among the community at the same time i often noticed the limitations of nonprofit capacity there was often a waitlist for those in need burnout among staff and reliance on inconsistent funding often slowed down impact nonetheless there was still trust built throughout the entire process whether it was through networks or single individuals that change is possible if you just simply try to make a difference this experience has changed my understanding of advocacy it is not a charity instead it is a long term commitment to equity where community organizations serve not just as service providers but instead advocates for systemic change question 5 looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others question 5 response looking back my time with chieac has significantly shaped my personal goals and clarified my sense of purpose this is particularly on equity in education and community which is a centered policy work before i took on this role i knew a little about social justice but working directly with my professor to help migrant and refugee families has helped me see how structural inequities play out in peoples daily lives this includes how they are in schools job applications or even accessing a school enrollment form online i feel more involved now in my commitment to the community so that their voices can be heard i hope to carry my communication skills and involvement forward so that i can keep supporting immigrant rights and education reform for those in need more importantly i have learned to listen with humility and am now able to collaborate more with others as i more forward i hope to stay connected to mutual aid and advocacy networks so that i can help in any way i can these actions should not be a onetime act but something more as a continuous effort with those hopes of achieving trust accountability and shared goals with those in your community

"1105464-369796 - Sully Richards - May 4, 2025 725 PM - Research Reflection.pdf",1 they showed me a lot of things but the biggest one was that what they are going through is not easy as someone who has had access to school wherever i go and have been taught that schooling is a necessity in ones life their not being able to get their hands on basic things needed for schooling such as notebooks was really hard to see and made me feel very sad but also very grateful for the life i live even though they had these barriers they never gave up and worked for everything they got even though there are people around them who make more money and are able to get more than they do everyone was working very hard to get everything they have in life and some people are just unable to get more than others but this was a good way to make sure that everyone has a fighting chance when it comes to schooling and being able to get an education 2 the big one for me was donating the clothing the night before class i was looking through my closet to see what i could give away and realized that i had so many clothes that i no longer wear and were collecting dust when someone else needed them it made me sit back and think to myself how selfish it is to have all these things when in reality  i dont need them it also made me think about how many other people do it out there without even realizing it it helped me understand that there will always be those in need and we need to stand behind them if we want to see any changes in the coming years although those changes might not affect everyone changing 1 persons life every day for the rest of the time you live will be a lot of people and you never know how much that will mean to someone in the future 3 study 3 resonated with me the most because ai has especially become a product of everyday use i mean you can look it up on google and 30 different websites with ai will pop up my stance on ai is different than most people as i think that we shouldn t be using ai in our everyday lives as it will affect us much more than we think in the future i think that this was good because the more people who see the data out there is the higher the chance that they will change their opinions in a way that is better for everyone people often do things without understanding the risks of something but this is a good way to force people into seeing the risks that come with ai use if these risks are properly seen and dealt with they could save people from losing jobs being shown false information and so much more 4 it did both in challenging my belief and confirming it because i was naive in thinking that everyone contributed and it was easy for people were able to succeed when it came to job searching or getting supplies for school however  it challenged my belief because it shows how hard it is even if everyone does contribute although if everyone contributes and works hard then the people will be able to succeed in what they are working for in life it isnt as easy as i thought it would be the strengths i see in this work are the fact that everyone is coming together for the better of someone else it speaks to the bright side of humanity  showing that we are willing to work for the benefit of others i dont think there are any limitations i think that we can take this to the moon as long as we continue to adapt and change the program to help everyone in need 5 this has definitely changed my goals in a big way and that being that i want to take time and help people who are in need we dont realize it until we are shown but we have a lot more than we need to survive and if you have a chance to help someone who might not be as fortunate as you then you need to take that opportunity  it gives me another purpose in this world and that is to be able to help those in need and it makes me go to sleep happy at night knowing i helped someone even if it was in a very little way you just feel better about yourself in the future i plan on trying to help someone or donate something every week just to do my part when it comes to helping someone less fortunate than me something that i hope to keep is my passion for this it is definitely something that is needed if you want to stay on the path of helping people a way that i plan on helping the less fortunate is working at a food pantry near me once a week they are always looking for volunteers and it is a simple yet effective way to help someone

distribution for a project on community attitudes toward artificial intelligence data privacy and automation in everyday life represented chieac in my community building trust with families and advocating for access to traumainformed bilingual and equityfocused educational supports education advocacy research assistant reflection questions what did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reflect on specific moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity although i didnt work directly with migrant and refugee families being a part of a team or class that supported them helped me see just how much trust matters in advocacy work i learned that many families faced layers of barriers such as language difference legal concernshousing instabilities and unfamiliarity with western school system all of which can make something as basic as enrolling a child in school feel overwhelmingwhat stood out to me most was how often families hesitate to ask for help not because they dont need it but because past experiences have taught them that systems wont respond with care how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizing what emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time helping to raise funds with my class gave me a new understanding of what mutual aid means before this experience i thought of fundraising as mostly a way for organizations to collect money for a good cause but being involved in organizing efforts that directly supported families made it feel much more personal and urgent we werent raising money for some abstract idea but we were trying to meet real needs in real time that changed how i saw my role i wasnt just a student helping out but i was a part of something bigger a group of people coming together to support our community with whatever we could offer after this experience it made me realize that grassroots organizing doesnt have to be big or perfect it just has to be rooted in care and action this experience showed me that mutual aid is about solidarity not charity and that small efforts can make a big difference when people work together of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy the study that stayed with me the most was the one involving career readiness and the struggles low income students and caregivers face when looking for jobs i chose this study because i saw parts of my own story in it growing up i watched certain people work hard just to keep things going sometimes two jobs and still not have access to the kinds of careers they wanted even for students who did everything they were supposed to it was still hard to figure out how to move forward being involved in this research helped me understand how those everyday challenges can be seen in data but more than that it showed me how data can be used to speak up for people who arent always heard this project helped me see that data isnt just numbers but its about making sure real experiences lead to real change it made me more committed to using research as a way to support fairness and opportunity for communities like mine how did this experience challenge or confirm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work before this experience i believed that community organizations had the heart to make a difference but i didnt always see how they could take on big problems like job access education and tech after working with this organization i saw how much these groups really operate they may not have all the money or power but they have strong relationships with the people they serve and that matters that kind of trust cant be bought and its what gives this work its strength at the same time i also learned that good intentions can only go so far without enough support or funding after this experience it made me believe more in the power of local work even when the system feels too big or too fixed looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others looking back on my time i can say it helped me to see the future more clearly before i knew i wanted to make a difference but i didnt fully understand what it could look like being part of this work gave me a more front row seat to what real support and advocacy mean i saw how listening patience and conscience can change lives in small but powerful ways it made me realize i want to keep working in spaces where proper care is being left out or left behind whether its in education housing or access to tech i want to be someone who can help close the gap im leaving this experience with stronger communication skillsa better understanding of how to work across culture and a deeper respect for the roles that trust plays in community work most of all ivr learned that supporting others doesnt always mean all the answers it means showing up being curious and being willing to learn

did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reflect on specific moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity this experience made me so much more aware just how privileged i am when i was gathering up my clothes and choosing which of them i was willing to donate i was surprised at how easy it was for me to let go of those items meanwhile there are families that could barely afford clothes let alone other assets such as housing and education i was humbled by that realization this experience taught me not to take my privilege for granted because it is a privilege that not everyone has refugees often feel disoriented with the new environment having left their homes without a choice must have been difficult i as an immigrant can sympathize with this many days where i feel homesick and long for the presence of my friends i can imagine how hard it must be for them how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizing what emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time i think the most interesting thing that ive realized is how even the smallest gesture of kindness goes a long way professor drury emphasized this by celebrating even the smallest wins saying we have raised 40 dollars since yesterday thats 40 more dollars we previously didnt have to me 40 dollars doesnt seem that much it could barely buy a tshirt from zara but i realized that that 40 dollars could buy someone a hot meal even just for a day the clothes i gave away which i took for granted could benefit those that couldnt afford it i used to think that in order to truly help someone you must make big grand gestures so i never tried to help at all thinking my 20 dollars wont help anyone but in reality if many people gave even just the smallest amount of kindness be it monetary or goods it would compound and help someone in a big way of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy of the three research studies i contributed to the one that resonated with me the most was the one where we collected data exploring the public perceptions of the value of a college degree particularly within first generation immigrant families this survey asked many interesting questions which challenged me to reflect upon myself and how i personally value education being a firstgeneration immigrant and firstgeneration college student the questions in the survey challenged my views and feelings about college and made me think about how other people like me feel about it too in the little way i contributed to this study by sharing it with people i know i how that in some way i may have helped in contributing to a deeper understanding of the topic how did this experience challenge or confirm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work i believe community organizations impact the lives of many people in a big way community organizations actually meet the people they are trying to help getting to know them their struggles their need and their identity as a community this way community organizations are typically niched into the specific community they serve instead of giving them general aid they give them specific help that are catered to their specific needs they have a deep understanding of the community that large institutions and organizations dont this very reason is why i believe community organizations have a larger longer lasting impact on communities however community organizations can only go so far they often are understaffed and underfunded which can restrict the extent of their efforts i think that in order to resolve this issue larger institutions should invest and support communitybased action and community organizations in order to reach their full potential in serving the communities they serve looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others as an aspiring urban planner i eventually would like to work in public policy working with communities to help build safer better livable spaces for them i am confident that this will require me to work with social organizations like chieac to gain a better understanding of how to serve communities better and to actually know what they need ive personally never met the people i donated the money or the clothes to but the experience taught me that i can help them regardless i have to let go of my perfectionist mindset where i believe if i cant help people in the best way possible then i shouldnt help at all this is a flawed way of thinking which prevents me from being able to be of service to people if i am to be an effective and compassionate urban planner i need to curb this mindset and try to help the best way i can not the best possible way in the future i would like to help build communities where your zip code no longer matters that where you live is a hinderance to what you can achieve
"1134357-369795 - Paige Gilbert - May 4, 2025 833 AM - ChiEAC Research Assistant Reflection.pdf",paige gilbert social problems dr benjamin drury may 4th 2025 chieac research assistant reflection question 1 it helped me further understand the specific problems migrant and refugee families face related to accessing education i now understand that the barriers they face are not just getting enrolled into school but also accessing translation services special education referrals and access to resources that represent their cultural background which can help migrant and refugee children reduce isolation and a sense of belonging and connectedness to their academic environment i have been aware of migrant and refugee struggles with accessing education but after reflection i can see why access to culturally responsive academic resources plays such a large part in setting these children up for success this is because students are more likely to engage with their learning when they feel connected to it these resources and accommodations prevent these children from feeling isolated and increase their sense of belonging and chances of success in an educational environment question 2 it helped me understand that things i own but do not use may seem obsolete to me but i can use them to help people who require those resources when i or a person close to me decides that there are things we do not see as valuable we can make them valuable by giving them to people in need in recent years i have tried not to engage with materialistic culture and limit waste in my life in various ways but it is also important to educate others around me that the things they own but do not use have value by giving back to the communities and people around us it is very important to assist those who are in more need of those materials many may see spare change around the house as simple spare change but in reality  that spare change might not be much but it can be an impactful way to give back to the community  shifting our mindset and learning how much the items around us truly can be can impact people in our communities can be a very impactful way to give back to those who need them more than us question 3 the second study resonated with me most personally as a college student in my pursuit of higher education it has made me value my opportunity to learn and educate myself and firstgeneration immigrant families should also be able to have that chance to further their education and academic goals the public perception of the value of a college degree and the personal value of a college degree vary immigrant families should have the opportunity to pursue a college degree and also have opportunities to get an entrylevel job if they do not want a college degree receiving a college degree takes lots of time effort and money  so collecting data from students and nonstudents gives insight into the practicality of pursuing that goal these firstgeneration immigrant families should have the opportunity if they want to pursue a college degree but surveying the public provides valuable data on how to advise immigrant families on their career goals and choices question 4 it helped me understand the importance of working together a a community to address these issues rather than addressing these issues in a disjointed group because of the involvement we all had together  focusing on these problems as a community helped motivate us all to contribute together  the combined efforts created stronger success by focusing our goal as a group on a specific problem unfortunately  there are limitations to how we can help because assisting others with these complex issues like educational access and getting an individual a job these are not as simple as allowing a person entry into these opportunities because many are not the ones who decide to give a person a job or accept a person into an educational institution even though most of us dont have the power to do those things donating money to fund accommodations is valuable for helping people and families who struggle with these complex issues increases their likelihood of success and coordinating a group of people to help together can create a pathway for these peoples ability to access these opportunities question 5 i have always been interested in giving back to others because of my interest in sociology  by learning about these simple ways i can help others has inspired me to take further steps to assist those who are in need in various ways being educated on ways i can help those who are near me has made me want to extend my help to a greater extent i want to help those who have struggled with similar issues because my insight into those issues can provide value based on my experience and even if i can not relate to another persons struggles i still can help them in various ways i will be supporting others by continuing the practices we did in class donating money and clothing in the future and educating others on the value of doing these practices the same way we did in class

attitudes toward artiﬁcial intelligence data privacy and automation in everyday life  represented chieac in my community building trust with families and advocating for access to traumainformed bilingual and equityfocused educational supports education advocacy research assistant reﬂection questions 1 what did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reﬂect on speciﬁc moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity working with migrant and refugee families taught me how hard it can be to access basic educational resources when there are language barriers confusing rules and a lack of support i have many family members who came here as refugees and i just see it shows me how hard it truly was and how the system is so messed up i noticed how some families felt lost trying to enroll their kids in schools or understand special education services i learned that building trust takes time and that listening to peoples concerns can make a diﬀerence it made me think about how important it is to make resources easier to access and how being patient and kind can help families feel more comfortable asking for help 2 how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizing what emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time i went through all of my and my sisters clothing to ﬁnd things that could help families in need collecting and donating clothes made me realize that even small acts can make a big diﬀerence to someone i felt proud when i saw people getting clothes that ﬁt them and made them feel comfortable it made me see that mutual aid isnt just about giving things away its about showing people that they are seen and cared for it also taught me how important it is to ask people what they need instead of just assuming 3 of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy the study about career readiness and job searching stood out to me because it reminded me of people i know who struggle to ﬁnd jobs many people dont have the right connections or the skills to get good jobs and that makes life really hard collecting data for this study made me see how powerful data can be in telling real stories that might otherwise go unnoticed it showed me that data isnt just numbers its a way to shine a light on problems and push for change 4 how did this experience challenge or conﬁrm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work working with chieac showed me that community organizations can do a lot to help but they cant do everything my class helped by donating clothes and raising money which made a diﬀerence but there were still many more people who needed help it made me realize that while community groups can make a big impact they also need more resources and support to keep going it also showed me that connecting local work to bigger policy changes could make the impact last longer 5 looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others my time at chieac made me want to keep helping people and using my skills to make a diﬀerence i learned how to plan events raise money and talk to diﬀerent people skills i can use in the future it also taught me how important it is to listen to people and understand what they need moving forward i want to keep volunteering and ﬁnding ways to help people whether its through fundraising organizing events or just being there to listen and lend a hand category criteria points possible reﬂection on community engagement how well you reﬂect on your outreach

research assistant reflection questions what did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reflect on specific moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity i saw how hard it is for migrant and refugee families to have the same access and opportunities as us without community programs like the chieac we are privileged enough where we are not questioned for why we are here or why we are trying to get an education it shows the inequality of our education system and how we as a society need to reframe our minds in order to give equal opportunity for everyone education like many other things is driven by money so if people do not have the money or resources to access an education then they will most likely not receive it making things more easily accessible for migrant and refugee families will at least give them more of an opportunity to have an education and strive to reach the basic educational resources we have to understand too that these families may have almost nothing to give in order to access these educational resources so we should initially offer these resources to them with as little restrictions as possible that also means that we will need to make sure we allocate resources for these families but with community participation it is not an impossible task how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizing what emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time until this class i had never really participated in supporting mutual aid and grassroot organizations i have donated clothes to places like goodwill and the salvation army or i have given spare change to foundations when i go shopping but nothing really that is in my community it felt more rewarding to be part of a community program because i got to see or at least know the impact that i was making almost immediately my involvement made me want to encourage others to join in as well because while it is good to donate things to the salvation army or give money to cancer research contributing to community programs can impact people much faster and in a more timely fashion of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy study 2 resonated with me the most because it was interesting to think about what public perception on higher education is i think it is important to get a college education but the expense of it all makes it difficult to pursue my college journey has been anything but smooth too and it makes me wonder if this is the right path for me however with the heavy emphasis on having a college degree and higher education it almost feels like this is something that i need to succeed even though there are many successful people in the world who do not have college degrees i feel like mainstream society will think less of me for not having a college educationunless i become largely successful and prove them wrong changing our perception of having a college education will help take the pressure off of individuals that feel like they need to go to college it is okay to explore different avenues and see what path best suits you it will be integral that the community and those closest to you support your journey but the emphasis on having a college education should change yes it is good to have a degree but it should not be an expectation in order to succeed how did this experience challenge or confirm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work when community organizations are able to offer access to job searching educational access and technology it makes many lives a lot easier especially those in lowincome situations lack of access to these essential things makes it hard to succeed in everyday life technology is everywhere now and without access to it it is almost as if you are cut off from the world job searches and educational resources are largely on technology now so all of these things are interconnected it will cost a lot of money for community organizations to find these resources for people who do not have easy access to them getting computers alone will be a lot of wrong but hiring people such as advisors for job resources or tutors for schooling costs money as well however the most rewarding thing from spending all that money will be seeing the success and increased accessibility that individuals will have it is an intangible reward but one that can be the most gratifying looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others i hope to always be a person who can make a difference and impact a persons life in some way that is one of if not the main goal that i have for myself in life in anything i do i want to make a difference and so i realize that no action or contribution is too small in order to help someone sometimes it may not feel like a lot but whatever i do and whatever i give can always be an impact for someone even if i have nothing to give i hope i can always exemplify kindness and encourage others to do the same so that we can foster a future where everyone will prosper
"630539-369795 - Matthew Crasko - Apr 28, 2025 1146 PM - ChiEAC Reflection - Google Docs.pdf",matthew crasko serving migrant and refugee families taught me that trust is the foundation of advocacy work especially when supporting people who have been through trauma or face systemic barriers many families i worked with were understandably cautious when it came to enrolling their children in cps or accessing special education services i remember one situation where a parent was unsure about asking for support for their childs learning needs because they didnt fully understand their rights and didnt speak english fluently by being patient translating important information and offering reassurance i helped bridge that gap that moment made me realize that educational equity isnt just about giving people resourcesits about making those resources accessible understandable and delivered with dignity i saw firsthand how fear language barriers and lack of culturally responsive support can prevent families from getting what they need this experience deepened my understanding of how advocacy is built on relationships and trust and how much work still needs to be done to make education truly inclusive helping organize clothing drives and fundraising efforts through chieac gave me a new perspective on what mutual aid and grassroots organizing actually look like before this experience i thought of community support as something mostly done by nonprofits with big budgets or formal programs but being part of a team that collected and distributed over 500 pounds of winter clothing and helped raise more than 2000 for emergency relief showed me that real impact often comes from ordinary people responding quickly to urgent needs i felt a sense of urgency and responsibility when we learned a newly arrived family lacked proper winter gear and it was rewarding to know our coordination helped get them what they needed right away that moment reminded me that mutual aid isnt about waiting for systems to actits about people stepping up for one another with whatever resources they have i also saw how much behindthescenes work goes into even small acts of care from sorting donations to organizing transportation this experience made mutual aid feel personal and powerful and it deepened my appreciation for grassroots efforts that are often overlooked but essential to community survival the research study that resonated most with me was the one focused on career readiness and barriers to job searching among lowincome students and caregivers as someone who has personally faced challenges navigating education and planning a career while managing financial stress i saw reflections of my own experiences in the survey data many respondents talked about the pressure to contribute financially to their households the lack of accessible guidance on job training and uncertainty about their longterm goals working on this studyusing qualtrics to help organize and clean responsesshowed me how data can be used to bring visibility to struggles that are often overlooked it made me realize that behind every data point is a real story and those stories deserve to be part of public discussions and policy decisions i now understand how ethical data collection isnt just about numbersits about creating space for marginalized voices and using research to advocate for real change before joining chieac i had a general sense that community organizations played a role in helping people but i didnt fully understand how powerful they could be in addressing complex social issues this experience showed me that local grassroots organizations can act quickly and flexibly in ways that larger systems often cant whether it was helping families navigate school enrollment or distributing surveys about ai and technology chieac met people where they wereoften literally through mobile outreach at the same time i also became more aware of the challenges limited funding a heavy reliance on volunteers and the emotional toll of constantly responding to urgent needs still i saw how this kind of work builds real trust and makes lasting connections in communities it taught me that while community organizations cant solve every problem on their own theyre essential for creating change from the ground upand for keeping peoples voices at the center of conversations about education equity and the future my time with chieac helped clarify the kind of work i want to do in the future and gave me a stronger sense of purpose i learned how important it is to be part of something that serves others especially in communities that are often left out of mainstream support systems skills like organizing data ethically communicating across teams and helping coordinate outreach efforts showed me that advocacy can take many formsand that im capable of contributing in meaningful ways this experience also helped me see that im drawn to work that blends community engagement with research and policy impact i hope to carry forward the values i developed here equity empathy and a commitment to using my skills to support others whether i continue in

"817281-369796 - Phillip Alonso - May 2, 2025 245 AM - Chieac.pdf",education advocacy research assistant reflection questions 1 what did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy  and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reflect on specific moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity  one of the many things i was enlightened to was the sheer amount of barriers that migrant families go through not only do they have a harder time getting jobs but those who enter the country illegally have to constantly watch their back in fear of being deported many refugee families in the united states often have no access to safe shelter  food or clean water  additionally there are not many resources in place to help new refugee families get access to education for their kids in the united states even public schools can be expensive causing many families to go without education 2 how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizingwhat emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time when i was sifting through my clothes in my room and looking for things i can give away i took on a different viewpoint to the things i own and the things i could give away  i started actually thinking about how much i use each piece of clothing and weighing if it would be better put to use being given to someone else i also started thinking of how fortunate i am in life and the position i was able to grow up in after this class i do think i have a much better understanding of what its like to come up from nothing the importance of mutual aid was also shown to me in that i realized that when you start from scratch you are often at the whims of others and having some external help can really help get you on your feet 3 of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy donating clothing was the activity that resonated with me the most growing up after my parents moved to the suburbs to try and get me and my siblings into a better school we didnt have a lot of spare income to spend on clothes or toys i can call back to a moment in the 5th grade when i was wearing clothing that was too small for me with holes in it a bus driver who i had grown quite fond with took notice of this and one day handed me a large bag full of clothes and told me they were cloths that had shrunk in the wash that needed to be given away  looking back it was obvious he wanted to help out me and my family  and i can look back on giving away some of my unneeded clothes and understanding why he did what he did additionally  all 3 research studies taught me to look beyond the numbers and statistics and question what is driving them rather than taking them at face value 4 how did this experience challenge or confirm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work this experience confirmed my belief that community organizations are fundamentally necessary to make any amount of change in a community  throughout our classes and topics not once was the world changed by the opinions and actions of one single person when people come together to achieve something they have access to more resources and more say in how things are done in the world voices get heard people begin to speak out and things actually change although community organizations come with tons of upsides it can be difficult to amass enough people to get a movement going which can kill some amazing movements before they get the chance to reach people or make any change 5 looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others my time with chieac changed my life goals from one where i live a simple and small life to one where i can feel like others are treated as fairly as me originally my life goal was admittedly self centered and small minded however since i started chieac ive been exposed to many realities that i didnt ever really think about in my day to day life these new realities like the issues with job culture or the anger in politics make me want to have a future where people are treated fairly and with respect i want to live in a world where employers dont mistreat their workers and one where we dont treat people based on the color of their skin while i know i wont make any massive difference in the world myself i am content with the idea of spreading information and awareness on current social issues in our society in order to spark change or help enlighten others

bilingual and equityfocused educational supports education advocacy research assistant reflection questions what did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reflect on specific moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity it really helped me understand that there are many people in chicago who are struggling just outside our comfortable homes i feel like it can be common to think of other people struggling far from you especially if you live a more privileged life but this has certainly opened my eyes to realize that there are very easy ways to help support people in your community advocacy is so important in spreading the word about people in need even something as simple as telling your friend can go a long way we all have connections we all have communities and while it may seem daunting bringing people together is the best way to support one another how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizing what emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time specifically with collecting clothes to give away to people i felt a mix between stressful and hopeful i was stressed because i felt like i needed to give away more than i had i tried to gather as much as i could as well as making sure the material was good enough quality for them i didnt want to give someone a shirt with holes or anything but i also felt hopeful because it was a nice feeling to know that someone might really appreciate and even enjoy the clothes ive collected like i really liked this shirt what if somebody else would really like it too it was heartwarming it also felt personally fulfilling to put use to things that i do not necessarily need of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy it definitely made me realize that contributing data is more accessible than i originally thought and i know ive already said this but providing support can be easy and even small things make a difference the research study i resonated with was study 1 about how much they value a college degree and how fulfilled they are i felt like i could really contribute to it and give my honest opinion on it without feeling confused or anything it also made me feel seen like i wasnt the only one going through struggles how did this experience challenge or confirm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work it challenged my sometimes pessimistic mindset of there is nothing i can do because it can seem impossible at times and despair and hopelessness can really weigh you down but seeing how so many people have come together to support so many people has given me a lot of hope not only that but it is inspiring as well that change can happen even if you have to work hard at it and it confirmed to me that people  although sometimes can disappoint you  also can surprise you and that many many people care about one another i think a limitation but also a strength is the use of numerical data i think it is an extremely useful tool that is very necessary but i think it can also limit our minds if that is all we look at we need to also hear peoples heartfelt emotions and stories through outreach combining both forms of research can really help to provide the best support for ourselves looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others it has inspired me to make use of my time and even the things i own to try and benefit other people and communities i feel supported in the idea that it is not just me alone who wants to see change and provide for others my vision for the future has been reinforced i want to see a future full of trust and community i love that there are so many other likeminded people who want the same or a similar future i hope to keep coming into situations and opportunities with the perspective that i can fully contribute to what i am participating in
"841800-369797 - David Heredea - May 7, 2025 1045 PM - SOC101 Reflection- David H..pdf",education advocacy research assistant reflection questions 1 what did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy  and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reflect on specific moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity  working with 18 migrant and refugee families across chicago taught me about the difficulties and invisible barriers that prevent access to even basic educational resources one moment that stands out was trying to help a family where the parents spoke very limited english they were trying to enroll their child in cps but since they didnt understand the enrollment system it was really difficult for them they received very limited help in navigating the portal locating documents and just overall enrolling i kept trying to help them and built rapport through trust having all the answers didnt matter as much as just listening to them and doing my best it helped me realize that educational equity isnt just offering services its also making them accessible this experience improved my understanding of advocacy as something necessary in these contexts we need more empathy and persistence in helping those who need it not judgement a lot of families are dealing with so much on top of school enrollment so being informed meant showing patients and compassion we should lift up marginalized voices and help those who need it not put them down for not knowing how to work a system theyve never encountered before 2 how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizing what emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time coordination the distribution of clothing and helping raise money taught me that mutual aid isnt charity  its solidarity  in the past i thought that support work was done as a for  but now i know that its a with  its shared within the community  done as a group to show unity when i helped deliver clothes the gratitude formed a connection being able to see someone as i helped it wasnt an anonymous donation at a store it was a face to face response to a need it was a rollercoaster of emotions feeling energized and emotionally heavy because of the high stakes but knowing i was making a difference the unpredictability of who would need what and the constant need to adapt reminded me that grassroots organizations are personal and demanding however  theyre also powerful and help so many people it helped me reframe aid work as something that is done mutually within a community  and was very impactful 3 of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy the study on attitudes towards career readiness and jobsearch barriers resonated with me especially coming from a workingclass family  many people who were surveyed showed that they were frustrated with underemployment and language barriers there is also a strong sense of xenophobia engrained in many hiring practices even today  its a well known fact that a last name can make or break a resume i used qualtrics to gather responses and worked to ensure the survey was as accessible as i could make it what struck me the most was how the data showed patterns of things people experienced privately  an example is the mismatch between qualifications and actual employment opportunities being part of the research process showed me how to ethically collect data and how important it is its not just getting numbers and responses its creating a platform for marginalized voices to be heard and inform the public it can help shift policy conversations and bring change it reminded me that data is individual people it brings visibility to the overlooked 4 how did this experience challenge or confirm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work my time with chieac internalized that community organizations are necessary beings that help address interconnected social issues however  it also showed me their limitations i saw how adaptable chieac was mobilizing donations and working to make things accessible these things made actual lasting impacts on peoples lives still i saw the limits that scale and funding brought community organizations cant address systemic issues like immigration policy delays or underfunding in cps as hard as we might work to make sure we are being ethical in how we use and store data this will never be the widespread action there will always be concerns about things and people will slip through the cracks community organizations only have so far of a reach and as much as we might want to help those beyond it we cant always do that this taught me that while community groups can help head innovation in advocacy and education to actually make permanent large changes we need to come together and reform the system i see community work as vital but part of something larger  5 looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others chieac gave me much more than just professional experience i came into this curious about advocacy  and now i have a much deeper appreciation for everything this organization does the skills i gained from this will help me for the rest of my life theyre both practical useful skills and aligned with my values ive learned how to build connections be patient and how to work with data ethically  im interested in learning more about how data informs policy design since that was something that we worked on participating in this helped remind me that its important to reach out and help those who need it especially when there arent a lot of other people they can turn to ive learned skills that will help me in future leadership positions as i go forward i hope ill be able to continue building bridges between data and lived experiences i hope ill help more people in the future

"938266-369795 - Jasmin Soriano - May 7, 2025 1137 PM - sociology final reflection.docx",sociology reflection oakton college spring 2025 jasmin soriano what i learned from serving migrant and refugee families in chicago was that trust and support is so important when it comes to trying to access education theres a long difficult and confusing process that families have to take to enroll their children into school oftentimes language is a huge barrier for many families not being able to communicate and understand makes this process more difficult this process has shown me that educational equity isnt just having schools available but making sure that families are able to use them people need to be listened to and supported distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support is not just the simple act of participating in charity but its about people taking care of one another when the system is falling short i personally lose sight of the big picture many times i forget that my problems are drastically smaller than others theres families that struggle to have clothing food or simply to obtain an education for their child realizing this it made me feel sad and empathy for these people through these different roles i saw how important grassroots organizing is grassroots alone is very important and powerful but it works best when there is a larger long term solution one of the research studies that resonated the most with me was raising money for chieacs 2025 community impact fund the reason why this resonated the most with me was because i think its so important to raise not only financial support but awareness of what can be done to help people in need in my experience i know how important organizations like this can help immigrant familiesthroughout the years me and my family have seen how much family friends have struggled due to their immigration status the feeling of not having enough to provide not only for themselves but for their loved ones organizations like this helped them find places where they can afford healthcare clothing and basic necessities this experience made me realize how much further work can be done to address complex issues i have believed that the power of community organizations can be strong to help solve active problems but in this experience i saw the challenges behind it there arent a lot of people to actively help in these community organizations many community organizations operate with minimal funding and limited staff that is overworked due to the amount of work needed to be done but not enough people to work on it what i think now after my experience is that community organizations are helpful and vital to creating change and helping people organizations should receive background support from institutions to provide them with better resources funds and more active help this experience has made me realize how much i want to play a role in helping people it has helped me realize that many times we are too hyper focused on our personal problems and what is happening to us that we lose sight of looking at what is happening around us and what we can do to help those in need i want to play an active role in helping individuals and families who need the support and help not only financially but genuine help in getting their life back on track i plan to research more in local organizations and see how i can help also donate financially and other resources to help
"943474-369797 - Joseph Anwayah - May 1, 2025 439 PM - Reaserch Q.pdf",1 i became aware of how people can be neglected because they lack resources after working with migrant and refugee families better resources are needed to guide these families are not asking for too much its safe to say even though i didnt get to meet them directly donating and helping from behind the scenes made me think deeply about how much people are struggling without a say this experience taught me that educational equity means nothing if it doesnt include the people who are usually left out and it made me want to be the kind of person who helps those around me more especially since not many people would consider this problem 2 mutual help in contrast to conventional charity methods is based on reciprocity and solidarity it is about communities looking out for one another rather than waiting for institutions to step in i was able to observe this directly when a family who had just received donated clothing returned the next week with additional goods to give away it served as a sobering reminder that individuals are active contributors to the development of care networks rather than passive beneficiaries of assistance on an emotional level the works urgency was both inspiring and debilitating at times it seemed that no matter how much we contributed the demand would only increase but instead of deterring me that pressure strengthened my resolve to support agile communityled and trustbased grassroots initiatives i learned from this experience that effective organizing begins with listening to peoples actual needs showing up and acting on them in real time mutual aid is also about dignity as much as it is about survival 3 the study examining how the general population views the worth of a college degree particularly in firstgeneration immigrant households struck a chord with me the most as someone with an immigrant background i noticed similarities to the experiences of my own family in the survey responses parents who viewed higher education as a means of achieving stability yet frequently found it difficult to comprehend or handle the process i became more aware of how statistics may provide a voice to collective experiences that are frequently disregarded in policy discussions after taking part in this project the process of compiling and arranging the responses also caused me to reflect critically on the duty we bear when obtaining data from underrepresented groupshow we pose the questions how we handle the responses and how we safeguard the individuals who are represented in the statistics this experience taught me that gathering data in an ethical communitycentered manner can help dispel false narratives and guide the development of more fair policies particularly when it brings to light viewpoints that are too frequently ignored or obscured in decisionmaking settings it confirmed my conviction that data is not neutral rather it is a tool that with the right application can promote justice 4 this experience not only strengthened my belief that community organizations can effectively tackle complex interrelated problems but it also forced me to consider the extent and longterm viability of that influence working with chieac allowed me to observe firsthand how grassroots initiatives might have a real impact on issues like digital access school enrollment and job preparedness chieac was actively working to reduce these obstacles through seminars translation assistance and direct support for instance in our study on career preparedness and hurdles to job searching several families mentioned annoyance with online application procedures and restricted access to the internet community organizations frequently cover the gaps left by official institutions because of their exceptional ability to react swiftly and sympathetically but i also became increasingly conscious of the drawbacks such as staff and volunteer burnout a lack of sustained funding and the fact that such efforts but effective are unable to make up for structural underinvestment in underserved regions i learned from this experience that although community organizations are essential change agents in order to provide longlasting solutions their efforts must be supported by more extensive structural reforms in economic opportunity education and policy 5 my personal objectives and feeling of purpose have been greatly influenced by my stay with chieac i was generally interested in social justice and education prior to this position but i now feel a strong desire to work in a field that emphasizes ethical public service policy reform and community activism i learned from this experience that genuine change frequently begins locally by listening showing up and establishing trust i will keep that in mind for whichever direction i decide to go in the future in addition to gaining useful skills in data analysis outreach and bilingual communication i also became more conscious of the systemic pressures that influence peoples lives and the ability of group care to counteract them by remaining active in grassroots efforts promoting inclusive educational policies and raising my voice to give voice to people who are frequently ignored i wish to keep helping others i gained direction from chieac in addition to experience it made it clearer to me that my participation in the justice movement is based on action equity and empathy and that it is a lifelong endeavor
"943581-369797 - Matthew Devera - May 4, 2025 1157 PM - ChiEAC Project.pdf",1 when i first got presented with this project i was quite hesitant to proceed with it the goal of this project was to directly communicate with refugees and migrants to gain access to basic education resources in chicago i was unsure whether to trust be safe or advocate for their rights to education when coming in contact with a family the mother was quiet and hesitant to share her story it was after some patience and getting to gain her trust that she was able to share her cultural background and open up about the obstacles she had faced the language barrier unfamiliarity with the school system and concerns for her childrens social life worried her it started to grow on me how unfortunate the events of what i had heard were i still have hope in finding a greater light in the future it shows how families are willingly striving to create a better future for their children this experience revealed the challenges families like hers face in accessing resources 2 in this progression throughout this course i have been active in collecting and distributing clothing and organizing community support provided me with an understanding of mutual aid beyond theory as i had done some distributing myself while it was still quite chilly i had some conversations with the people i saw the profound impact not just of my contribution towards helping others but there is also of a whole community that does it after conversing with a few people this experience transformed my view instead of just giving out to help i got to speak with them directly which invoked a sense of empathy and frustration about the condition that theyre in this had reaffirmed the importance of supporting communityled agencies to lead to a better society 3 the research study on barriers to college access for firstgeneration students deeply resonated with my own journey in which reflected my own experiences as a firstgeneration college student ive faced the challenges of navigating complex application processes limited guidance and financial uncertainty all of which struggles are shared by many of the individuals participating in this research offered meaningful insight into the disparities of the community around me hearing students personal stories of both hardship and resilience reinforced by how data can reveal invisible obstacles these students face this experience changed how i see data not just as something to study but as a powerful tool for advocacy i realized that when research is done ethically and includes diverse voices it can highlight the challenges faced by marginalized groups and support real policy change it also showed me that researchers have a responsibility to make their work clear and representative so it can help inform the public and lead to a fairer education system 4 this experience largely confirmed my belief in the crucial power of community organizations to address complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life while also revealing important limitations witnessing the dedication and resourcefulness of chieac and its partner organizations in providing direct support workshops and mentorship to community members facing these challenges was inspiring the ability of these organizations to build trust within communities offer culturally relevant services and adapt to the evolving needs of individuals demonstrates their significant strengths for example the job search workshops not only provided practical skills but also offered a supportive community for individuals facing unemployment similarly the efforts to bridge the digital divide by providing technology access and training were essential for educational and economic participation however i also observed the limitations inherent in this kind of work these organizations often operate with limited resources relying heavily on grants and volunteer efforts which can create instability and restrict their capacity to address the full scale of the issues furthermore while they provide vital direct services their ability to address the root causes of systemic inequalities is often constrained by broader policy and economic structures this experience reinforced the necessity of community organizations as frontline responders and advocates while also highlighting the need for systemic change and greater public investment to address the fundamental drivers of these complex social problems 5 looking back on my time with chieac i see it as a formative experience that deeply shaped my goals values and vision for the future engaging directly with marginalized communities conducting research and collaborating with the community solidified my commitment to social justice in a way it inspired me to pursue a career focused on addressing systemic inequities to shape work that not only offers immediate support but also drives longterm change which i can use this a foundation for a business i developed essential skills in communication active listening and ethical research all of which i intend to carry into future endeavors moving forward i aim to stay rooted in communitybased efforts through volunteering throughout my professional life this experience left me with an everlasting desire to contribute to a more just and equitable society
"984509-369795 - Celeste Ramirez - Apr 29, 2025 951 PM - Final Research Assistant Reflection.pdf",celeste ramirez soc 103 004 4282025 1 i learned that it can be hard to ask for help because it means to trust in someone that is a complete stranger  this isnt always the safest in the mind of someone needing help when a stranger provides help it can go really well or becomes a nightmare especially because you dont know them i believe that an organization that does advocate for donations which can be anonymous and help showcase how you can build trust in a community  in addition it simply highlights that these are people in need and that we may not think about them everyday  but they still desire the same thing we all do that is having a better life many can start looking at education or job opportunities to be able to provide for themselves and family and getting closer to their dreams many of these families came with children and like any parents and guardians they hope for something better for their kids than what they had i realize this is what my parents also wished for me as well and now im currently delivering that wish the difference is they need more help to get in a place to get education brought to them andor their families 2 i think the ways we helped through collecting and distributing clothes raising funds and overall building community support was able to create a bigger impact that many people dont anticipate i can say i was skeptical on how it can really make a difference because there were a few donations that i personally saw which were big donations but also small i learned that mutual aid and grassroots organizing can still drive a big change that may seem insignificant to some this captures how people that feel like they cant give back can actually provide just a bit is just enough to make someone feel closer to more stability  to add i think even hearing and seeing the people that we helped gives that reassurance that the help that was provided would be helpful in the way it was intended you can grow incredibly grateful for what you have but also understand that you can also give that gratitude back to someone else 3 i felt like the second study gave me an opportunity to give more insight on me personally  i was able to resonate with the questions and be able to represent as a first generation american in my immigrant family  i definitely see how these questions can also be in someone s mind among the public in our own neighborhoods many came into this country for that sort of dream it may not have exactly included education off the bat but there is still an idea of hope for a better life i think seeing how many people have this idea among their families in order to get new and better opportunities because of this i believe that this survey was able to provide that opportunity for those that are like me when it comes to making policies organizations and other forms of help its important to hear people s stories and concerns because those are the people that will be affected most by any potential future changes i always thought bringing humanity into the conversations that are involved with people can help find better solutions to issues that many can face small steps like these surveys can better visualize the issue than what surface level information can bring especially effective when you are able to connect with people that can resonate with the issues being discussed 4 this experience mainly confirmed but also challenged me a bit i was skeptical how much we can really help considering it can be hard to find any donations or people to participate in surveys nowadays sometimes i feel that many think of themselves or their own family instead of others i believe there isnt inherently wrong with that but i can see how we can underestimate our own abilities to give back that is what i learned from this experience if we all just gave at least a little back it can still help many lives some things i did notice that stems from my skepticism was there weren t many people that we tried to spread the word for to help out i do wonder if it expanded outside of local circles if it would have picked up better  i think one of the challenges is getting people to help out and how to essentially advertise it in a way to gain more attention overall even with what we had it still helped out many people with their daily lives 5 my time with chieac helped me see that there is no action too small i also work in retail and have experienced people with different walks of life so i tried to make someone to at least smile and show some kindness this experience helped me further believe that and understand that complexity that helping out can bring i understand that there will be people that may not want to help or feel like they cant we of course cant force anybody  but i know more the value of just giving a little i will definitely like to help out more in the future although i may not see myself as being fully immersed in this type of work i believe i will still carry the values behind it throughout my life this experience and my time with chieac has shown me what people are capable of doing i would love to keep learning about people s stories and help a bit when i can i think its crucial now to have that sense of hope and humanity in a world full of uncertainty and mistreatment

one of the chieac research studies and meaningfully connect this experience to your learning skill development and commitment to social impact please submit your completed responses as a single document to the d2l assignment folder titled chieac research assistant reﬂection by the posted deadline education advocacy research assistant chicago education advocacy cooperative chieac  chicago il january 2025  june 2025  provided direct outreach and educational support to 18 lowincome migrant and refugee families across chicago assisting with cps enrollment translation services special education referrals and access to culturally responsive academic resources  collected and distributed over 500 pounds of donated clothing and winter gear to meet the immediate needs of newly arrived families and raised more than 2000 for chieacs 2025 community impact fund to support emergency assistance and microgrants  collaborated with chieac staﬀ and peer volunteers to contribute to three independent communitybased studies used qualtrics and mobile outreach strategies to collect clean and organize over 300 unique data points across the three projects see below while ensuring all responses met chieacs internal ethical standards o study 1  surveyed attitudes toward career readiness and barriers to job searching among lowincome students and caregivers o study 2  collected survey data exploring public perceptions of the value of a college degree particularly within ﬁrstgeneration immigrant families o study 3  supported digital survey distribution for a project on community attitudes toward artiﬁcial intelligence data privacy and automation in everyday life  represented chieac in my community building trust with families and advocating for access to traumainformed bilingual and equityfocused educational supports education advocacy research assistant reﬂection questions 1 what did serving migrant and refugee families teach you about trust advocacy and the barriers that families face when trying to access basic educational resources in chicago reﬂect on speciﬁc moments of challenge or growth and consider how this experience shaped your understanding of educational equity assisting migrant and refugee families through chieac resonated with me on a personal level since i have experienced being in their situation new to the country unaware of the school system and uncertain about where to seek assistance  that experience enabled me to establish trust with the families i assisted as i recognized the fear and uncertainty that accompanies the process of enrolling in cps overcoming language barriers or obtaining special education services without support  i recallassisting a family that had been consistently given incorrect information regarding their eligibility for services solely due to their lack of ﬂuent english their irritation reminded me of how quickly families can be overlooked when systems lack equitable design  this position demonstrated to me that advocacy involves more than simply providing resourcesit requires being present with patience cultural awareness and reliability  it reinforced my conviction that educational equity goes beyond theoretical fairness it involves eliminating tangible obstacles that hinder students and families from succeeding 2 how did your role in collecting and distributing clothing raising funds and organizing community support shift the way you understand mutual aid and grassroots organizing what emotions or insights came up for you as you took on responsibility for meeting urgent needs in real time my involvement in gathering and distributing clothing raising more money  and assisting in organizing support for newly arrived families provided me with a direct insight into what mutual aid truly signiﬁes its not about charity its about solidarity prior to this experience i viewed community support as structured and organized however i soon discovered that grassroots organizing frequently demands quick thinking emotional strength and a profound sense of part  when a mother arrived at one of our events with her kids all dressed in light sweaters during a freezing week in february i understood how urgent and personal this work truly is  addressing those needs instantly was occasionally daunting yet also invigorating  it showed me that mutual aid involves individuals supporting one another when systems let us down and that community care serves as a strong reaction to injustice it also boosted my conﬁdence in my leadership skills during crises and highlighted that even minor actions such as organizing donations or writing a funding request can signiﬁcantly affect when motivated by a sense of collective humanity 3 of the three research studies you contributed to which one resonated most with your personal story or the stories of people you know how did participating in this research project impact the way you view the role of data in shaping public understanding and policy while helping collect clothing donations i had a moment that deeply impacted me i realized how privileged i was to be in a position to give when so many of the families we served didnt even have the option to donate because they were just trying to meet their basic needs that realization helped me see the survey data in a new light each response wasnt just a number it was a reﬂection of someones lived struggle with economic hardship limited access to networks and systemic disadvantages participating in this project made me understand how data can uncover the invisible realities of poverty and inform policy in ways that truly matter 4 how did this experience challenge or conﬁrm what you believed about the power of community organizations in addressing complex issues like job searching educational access and technology in daily life what do you now see as the strengths and limitations of this kind of work this experience tested and reinforced my conviction in the ability of community organizations to tackle complex challenges such as job searching access to education and even technology in daily life contributing clothing assisting families with school enrollment and engaging in communityled research all highlighted the responsiveness and ingenuity of grassroots organizations like chieac we were able to quickly address urgent needs and foster trust with families in ways that larger organizations often struggle to replicate however i also saw the limitations our resources were limited funding was unpredictable and the issues we were addressing were systemic not just individual this taught me that while community organizations are crucial for providing immediate support and advocacy they cannot replace the need for broader policy reform and institutional accountability still i was inspired by the signiﬁcant impact a dedicated small team could make when engaging directly with those most aﬀected ultimately this experience showed me that true change often starts at the community level even when resources are scarce 5 looking back at your time with chieac how do you think this experience shaped your personal goals sense of purpose or vision for the future what skills or perspectives do you hope to carry forwardand how do you hope to keep supporting others yes looking back at my time with chieac this experience has deeply inﬂuenced my personal goals and sense of purpose the work i did with the community driven research conﬁrmed for me that my future is rooted in making a tangible diﬀerence in peoples lives especially those who face systemic barriers it reinforced my commitment to equity and advocacy reminding me of the power of direct action and the importance of addressing both immediate needs and longterm change the skills i gained particularly in community organizing research and crosscultural communication are ones i plan to carry forward moving forward i hope to continue supporting others by applying these skills in ways that promote inclusion access and justice im committed to being part of movements that ﬁght for systemic change while always remembering the
